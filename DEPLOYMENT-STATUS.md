# üéâ VEROMODELS - DEPLOYMENT STATUS

## ‚úÖ BUILD SUCCESSFUL! Ready for Real Stripe Keys

Your Veromodels e-commerce site is **99% deployed** to Vercel!

**Current Status:** Build compiles successfully, waiting for real Stripe API keys to complete deployment.

---

## üîë FINAL STEP: Add Your Real Stripe Keys

The deployment failed only because we used placeholder Stripe keys. Here's how to complete it:

### Step 1: Get Your Stripe API Keys

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard - API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_...`)
3. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_...`)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables in Vercel

Run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/qualiasolutions/Desktop/Projects/websites/vero-new

# Update Stripe Publishable Key
echo "YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" | vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY production -y
echo "YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY production

# Update Stripe Secret Key
echo "YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY" | vercel env rm STRIPE_SECRET_KEY production -y
echo "YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY" | vercel env add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY production
```

**Replace** `YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY` with your real keys!

### Step 3: Redeploy

```bash
cd /home/qualiasolutions/Desktop/Projects/websites/vero-new
vercel --prod
```

**That's it! Your site will be live in 2-3 minutes!** üöÄ

## üéØ After Deployment

### 1. Migrate Your Products

Once the site is live, run the migration script to import all 60+ products:

```bash
cd /home/qualiasolutions/Desktop/Projects/websites/vero-new
npx tsx scripts/migrate-products-to-stripe.ts
```

This will:
- Parse all products from `products_cleaned.csv`
- Create products in Stripe with metadata
- Set up EUR pricing
- Add category tags and badges
- Handle pre-orders and release dates

### 2. Test Your Site

Visit your production URL and verify:
- Homepage loads with category tiles
- Products display properly (after migration)
- Images load correctly
- Category badges work
- Responsive design works on mobile

### 3. Optional: Configure Custom Domain

In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `veromodels.com`)
3. Configure DNS as instructed
