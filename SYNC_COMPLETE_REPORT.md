## 🎯 Next Steps

- Category pages (`/collection` and `/pre-order`)
- Individual product pages (`/product/[slug]`)

### 2. If Products Don't Appear Immediately:

```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart dev server
bun run dev
```

### 3. Test Specific Products:

Check these newly created products:
- `/product/mini-jcw-gp2-r56-thunder-grey-metallic-2012-118`
- `/product/renault-espace-2000-tse-rouge-cornaline-1984-118`

## 🔄 Maintaining Sync

### When to Re-run the Sync Script:

1. After adding new products to CSV
2. When products aren't showing on website
3. After manual Stripe Dashboard changes
4. Monthly maintenance

### Quick Sync Commands:

```bash
# Full sync
./scripts/run-sync.sh

# Dry run (preview changes)
./scripts/run-sync.sh --dry-run

# Sync specific product
./scripts/run-sync.sh --sku=30731
```

---

## 📊 Stripe Dashboard Verification

All products now have metadata like this:

```
slug: "product-url-slug"
category: "collection" or "pre-order"
sku: "30731"
```

You can verify this in:
**Stripe Dashboard → Products → Click any product → Metadata section**

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Minor):

1. **4 products missing images** (Peugeot 607, Mini JCW, Renault Espace, Suzuki SX4)
   - These are pre-orders
   - They'll display with placeholder or no image
   - Add images later via Stripe Dashboard

2. **Default pricing** (€99.99)
   - New products have placeholder prices
   - Update with actual prices in Stripe Dashboard

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators:

- ✅ All 73 products in Stripe
- ✅ All products have required metadata
- ✅ All products have prices
- ✅ Website can now discover and display all products
- ✅ Automated script available for future syncs
