## 🚀 Quick Start Deployment (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Configure Stripe Keys

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Copy your API keys
3. Update `.env.local`:

\`\`\`bash
# Replace these with your actual keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Migrate Products to Stripe

Run the automated migration script to import all 60+ products:

\`\`\`bash
cd /home/qualiasolutions/Desktop/Projects/websites/vero-new
npx tsx scripts/migrate-products-to-stripe.ts
\`\`\`

**What this does:**
- Parses `products_cleaned.csv`
- Creates products in Stripe with all metadata
- Sets up pricing in EUR
- Adds category tags, brands, and pre-order info
- Preserves all product images

**Expected time:** 2-3 minutes for 60 products

vercel --prod
\`\`\`
